```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE)
```

## Data and packages

```{r palmerpenguins}
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins
```

```{r ggplot2}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r boxplots-no-color}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = species)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r boxplot-colors}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = species, fill = species)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Now, comment on what you notice from these boxplots.

**The Gentoo species of penguin has the highest median flipper length. Whereas the Adelie species has the smallest flipper length on average**:


```{r jitterplot}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = species, color = species )) +
  geom_jitter()
```

Comment on the strengths of the boxplot compared to the jitterplot and vice versa.
That is, what can you easily determine by looking at the boxplot?
What about the jitterplot?

**The scatter plot shows each penguin on the individual level much more efficiently. We are able to see each groups scatter as opposed as to the box plot where it is limited by group metrics.**:


Knit, stage, commit (with a meaningful commit message),and push everything in your **Git** pane to your GitHub repo.
Then, go to GitHub and compare/contrast your `activity02-ggplot2-intro.Rmd` and `activity02-ggplot2-intro.md` files.
Which is easier to read?
Which looks more professional?

**The knitted file looks much more presentable in a report like format.**:


Now, wouldn't it be nice if we could combine these two plots so that we get the benefits of both!?!
That is, how can we overlay the jitterplot over the boxplot?
Try doing the following in the code chunk below with my *hint*:

- Re-create the boxplot with color that you did above, then
- *Add* another geometry layer for the jitterplot.

```{r box-jitter-combined}

```

Play around with doing the jitterplot laid over the boxplot and the boxplot laid over the jitterplot.
Which do you prefer?
Why?

**Response**:


This is getting us closer to one of my favorite plots - the raincloud plot.
We are not quite ready to create this plot, but we will get there eventually!

![raincloud plot](img/raincloud-plot.png)

Suppose that you wanted to only color the points in your combined plot, but not the individual boxplots - you want the boxplots to be the default white coloring.
In the code chunk below, explore different methods to try to create this plot.
A hint, all `geom_*` have a `mapping` argument.

```{r jitter-colored-only}

```

In the above code chunk, continue to play around with having the aesthetics mapped in the different layers.
For example, how does having all of them mapped in the `ggplot` call compared to having these instead mapped in the `geom_boxplot` layer?
Comment on what you notice.

**Response**:


Knit, stage, commit (with a meaningful commit message),and push everything in your **Git** pane to your GitHub repo.
Go to GitHub and verify that your `activity02-ggplot2-intro.Rmd` file appears as you intended it to.

### Exploration

Below is a histogram with a smoothed density (think proportion) area curve behind it.
I had to do a "trick" in my histogram layer to put both of these plots on the same y-axis scale, but we will ignore that for the time being.
There appear to be two noticeable peaks in the distributions of bill lengths: one around 39 mm and one around 46 mm.

![histogram and density plot](img/histogram-density.png)

Create graphs to explore the relationship between `bill_length_mm` and each of `species`, `sex`, and `island` (you should have three total graphs).
Using these three graphs to discuss which of these three categorical variables seems to be contributing more to these two peaks and explain your reasoning.

```{r bill_length_by_species}

```


```{r bill_length_by_sex}

```


```{r bill_length_by_island}

```

**Response**:


Knit, stage, commit (with a meaningful commit message),and push everything in your **Git** pane to your GitHub repo.
Go to GitHub and verify that your `activity02-ggplot2-intro.Rmd` file appears as you intended it to.

### Scatterplots

You created some scatterplots in Preparation 3.
Here we continue exploring scatterplots using `{ggplot2}`.

In the code chunk below, create a scatterplot for the relationship between `flipper_length_mm` and `body_mass_g`.

```{r flipper_vs_mass}

```

Describe any patterns that you notice.

**Response**:


Recreate your scatterplot in the code chunk below; however,  *map* `species` to the `color` and `shape` aesthetics.

```{r flipper_vs_mass_with_species}

```

Describe any patterns that you notice.

**Response**:


The previous plot looked great except even in this rather small dataset (n = 344), there might are a number of points overlapping.
In the R code chunk below, *set* the values (instead of mapping a variable to an aesthetic) of `size` (using some value larger than zero) and `alpha` (using some value between 0 and 1) to make your previous plot more effective.

```{r flipper_vs_mass_with_size_alpha}

```

Discuss the decisions you made to help your plot be easier to read.

**Response**:


Knit, stage, commit (with a meaningful commit message),and push everything in your **Git** pane to your GitHub repo.
Go to GitHub and verify that your `activity02-ggplot2-intro.Rmd` file appears as you intended it to.

You can now go back to the `README` file.
